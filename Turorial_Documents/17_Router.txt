Router-Outlet
	-it is built in directives
	- Every Angular should have alteast one router-outlet
	- By default router outlet is define in app.component.html
	- It wll match the routes for the components and take output and place it inside routeroutlet tags.
	- We can have multple router-outlet 

Multip;e Router outlet
	- we can define muotle routers outlets by giving name to them
	- we called them by names router outlets
	- ex : { path :'add'
	           component: 'addcomponent',
	           outlet : 'outlet'
	- It will not work if you try to access directly
	- to make it work we need to use below path
		- http://localhost:4200//<primary-route>( <router-name>: <secondaryPath>)
	- if we dont define the name then it will take default
