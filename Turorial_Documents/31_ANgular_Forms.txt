ANgular Forms
	- Static/Template Driven Forms
	- Dynamic/ Reactive Forms

Static/ Template Driven
	- easy to use
	- Template driven forms are simple and straight forward
	 - All validation, form elements are defined in the template file.
	- We will need to import FormsModule in app module to work with Template driven forms

Dynamic/ Reactive /Model Driven Forms
	- All the form elements, user interaction and validations are handled in the component class.
	- We will make use of Angular's built in formGroup and formControl
	- Can control better data binding
	- Exclusive deine custom regular expression patterns of error handling 
	- We will need t import ReactiveFormsModule in our app module
	- Very flexible and allows user to define, develop complex requinemnt of forms
	- More logi in the component class and less in HTML markup itself.

WHICH is BETTER? 
Template Driven Forms
	- If our application forms are simple straight forward 
	- Fixed static form fileds and elements
	- No complex validations or pattern matching

Reactive Forms
	- If our application forms are complex
	- Uses multiple dynamic components
	- Advance validation requinemnts
	- Dependent form elements
	- Dynamic form generation based on user preference	-
