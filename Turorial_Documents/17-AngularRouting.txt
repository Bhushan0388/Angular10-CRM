ANgular Routing - Component Routing

Common Mistakes 
	- devloper woll add "/" path
	- Component name in quotes
	- Bad form array of routes
	- Sometimes our editor are not importing components correctly.
	- Red color underline is that there is an error.

Router Outlet
	- It is an built in directive
	- Every angular app should have atleast 1 router outlest
		- Primary router outlet
	- by default - router outlet is defined in app.component.html file
	- Router outlet will match the matchin routes for the components
		- takes its output
			- inside the page
	- Multiple router outlest in application
		- We can have more than 1 router outlet
	
Multiple Router
	- There should be only 1 primary
	- We can define multiple router outlest by  giving name to them
	-- That's whey we call them names router outlets
	- We can give any name we want (give meaningful name)
	- if in routing model if we dont mentioned th ensame it will be primary by default
		{
   		 path:'add-loan',
	  	  component:LoantypesComponent,
  		  outlet:'outlet1'
		  }
	 - it will NOT show if you directly access it in the URL.
	- We can acess with below URL
		SYntax:

		localhost:4200/<primary-router>(<router-outletname>:secondary path) 
		Example :
		localhost:4200/loans(outlet1:add-loan)

Why we need multiple routers
	- Avoid useing this use case in application.
	- we can inject components
	- URL is not friendly.
