Parameterized Routes is also called as Dynamic Routes
	-We can send dynamice data or parameter
	- Url will look something like below
		http://localhost.com/user/10 > get user with id as 10
		http://localhost.com/search/ka/banglore > search by state and city
		http://localhost.com/user/10/photos/34 > user id is 10 and photo id is 34
	 
	- while writing dynamice URL/Params make sure we write colon(:) in URL
 		 {
  		  path:'product/:id/photo/:photoId',component:ProductComponent
  		}
	- Import the ActivatedRoute class
	- Create an object in constructor

		 constructor(private activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute) { 
   			 this.activatedRoute.params.subscribe((params)=>{
   				   console.log(params);
     				 this.photoId= params.photoId;
      				this.id=params.id;

   		 })
