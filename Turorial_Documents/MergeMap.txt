Flattening Operator
	MergeMap (combine all obseravble data)
		it means we subscibe 2 times as we will have multiple time observable data
		Maps each value to an Observable, then flattens all of these inner Observable using mergeAll
		map + mergeAll = MergeMap


	ConcateMap (it will combine data sequentially)
	SwtchMap 
		In this it cancel the older request and takes only latest

flatMap/mergeMap - creates an Observable immediately for any source item, all previous Observables are kept alive
concatMap - waits for the previous Observable to complete before creating the next one
switchMap - for any source item, completes the previous Observable and immediately creates the next one
