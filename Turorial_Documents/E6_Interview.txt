What is E6
ECMAScript 2015 is a sith major release of ECMA Language which come with a lot of new features and syntax for web writing aplication in javascritp
Currenlty , not all browser support ES6, They support previous version
So to write web applications in ES6 that will support all browsers we need tool like Babel and Webpack which comes in polifils

Features of Es6
	- Constant
	- Blacked scope support for both (let and const)
	 - Arrow Function
	- Extended Parameter Handling
	- Template Literals
	 Extended Literals
	- Enhanced Reggular Expression
	- Enhanced Object Properties
	 Support for Map/Set & WeakMap/WeakSet
	- Promises , MetaProgramming, Internationalization and Localizaition

what is use of let and const?
let is mutable variable


Explain Constants in ES6?
	Constant is a sp type where variables whose content is not changed
	We use const keyword
	Constant in ES6 enable protection to overwrite a varibale value, imprve performance and helps programmers to write readable and cleaner code

What are template literals in ES6?
	Template literals are the string with embedded code and variable inside.
	It allows concatenation and interpolation in much more comprehensive and clear win comparison with prior version on ECMAscript
	Concatenation and interpolation  is done by backtick '' in single line.
	To interpolate a variable simply put in to {} braces forwarded by $sign.
		ex : let a ="Hello"			
		       let b = "John"
		       let c = `${a}${b}`
			console.log (c) // Hello John

Spread Operator
	It is denoted by 3 dots (...)
	if we dont know how many values will be presnt in an array that time we use it
		let a  =[7,8,9]
		let b =[1,2,3,...a,10]
		console.log(b) //[1,2,3,7,8,9,10]

	ex: function print (..,z){}

What is Set in ES6
	Set is the collection of unique values. The values could be also primitives or object references.
	let set  = new Set()
	set.add(1)
	set.add('1')
	set.add({key:'value'})
	console.log(set(;//set {1,'1', object{key:'values'}}

Explain WeakMap?
WeakMap provide a way to extend object from the outside without interfering wiht garbage collection

Explain Generator Function?
	are function that can be exited and later reentered
	Their context will be saved across reentrance
	A function keyword is flowwed by asterisk defines a genrator function, which returns a generator object.
	ex : 
		function* generator(i){
		yield  i;
		yield i+10; }
	
		var get  generator(10);
		console.log(gen.next().value); // output : 10
		console.log(gen.next().value // 20 

What is Babel?
Its a javascript transipler
It allow us to write ES6 code and converts it back in preES6 Javascript that browser support.

Install babel?
	npm install savedev babel-cli

What is Webpack?
It asllows us to run an enviornment that host babel
Webpack is open source javascript module bundle that takes modules with dependencies and generate static assets reprsenting those modules

Benifits of Webpack
	It bundles multiple modules and get it inot single .js file
	It comes with intgrated dev server
	

Destructing Assignment in Es6?
It allows us to extract data from arrya and object into seprate variables

	let fullname=['Bhushan','Khaladkar'];
	let [firstname,lastname]=fullname;
	console.log(firstname,lastname) //Bhushan Khaladkar
