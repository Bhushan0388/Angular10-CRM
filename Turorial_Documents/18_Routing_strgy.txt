Routing Strategy
	- Routing behaviour of the application URLs.
	- ANgular provides 2 type of routing strategies
		- pathLocationStrategy
			- Default routing strategy for ANgular apps.
			- SImple, bookmarkable, easy to remember.
			- default HTML 5 push state URL
			- ex: 
				http://myapp.com/dashboard/
		- HashLocationStrategy
			- URL segments/patterns
			- URL's will have in the hash in the URL's
			- We need to import HashLocationStrategy from @angular/core
				import { HashLocationStrategy, LocationStrategy } from '@angular/common';

			- Add it to providers array in app.module.ts

				providers: [{
  				  provide:LocationStrategy, useClass:HashLocationStrategy
  				}],

			- Once it is loaded Angular starts using # in URL
			- URL ex: 
				http://myapp.com/#/dashboard/

Why do we need 2 different type of routing?
	- ANgular is a SPA(single page application)
		- index.html
	- When we are deploying it on cloud (AWS,GCP,Azure) it will treate path as folder.
	- useing # it will consider as it will consider as part of index path --index.html/#/loans.

Which one we should use when?
	- No difference 
	- while deployments
		- we will face issue -> # -> loans
