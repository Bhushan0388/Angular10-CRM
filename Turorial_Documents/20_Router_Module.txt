Routung Module/ App routing module
	- Its a single module and placeholder where all our routes  are configured for that 
	- each module can have its own routes
	- During the angule app installation
		- We get an option which will create an routing module
	- Syntax:
		ng g m app-routing --flat -module=app

Include the routing from scratch
	- Run abve command
	- Now import modules from package
		import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
	- We need to configure route path array in the file
		const routes: Routes = [];
	- We need to define(Dependecy injetion ) our module using @NgModule
		@NgModule({
		  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
		  exports: [RouterModule]
			})
	- We need to export the module
		export class AppRoutingModule { }
	- Now include module in AppModule file.
