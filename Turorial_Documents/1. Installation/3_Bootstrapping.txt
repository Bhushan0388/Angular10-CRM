Booting process

we run ng serve
	- it first compile the app
	- there is one file call main.ts which starts with booting process
	- In this we have BootstrapModule where it is stated to start the application with appmoddule
	- We can modify the by updating the AppModule with some other Module

Once we do the change we need to test it too in test.ts

test.ts
	-test script in main.ts

what is selector : what ever we define in compnent i.e. tempalte styleUrls it should come under selector

in Indesx.html
it will go to AppModule
in AppModule in bootsrap it will go in AppComponent
in AppComponent it will use selector <app-root>

Whenever we run ng serve/build/test
- Typescript is converted into javascript which is also called as transpiling
- it will generate main.js, vendor.js, pollifills.js,style.js, runtime.js
