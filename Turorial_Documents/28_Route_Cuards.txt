28_Route_Guards	
	- Helps us to secure our routes and screes
	 - ex: 
		-user -> Admin -> Route Guard
				-> Custom Logic
					-> True
						->can access the route
					->False
						-> custom logic on failure  

Syntax:
	ng g guard <guardname>

- Route Guards have something called "interfaces"
	- canActivate - checks if user can visit a route (authorization)
	- canActivate - Cchecks to see if a user can visit its child
	- canDeactivate - check if user can exit the route
	- canLoad - can lazy loading module be  loaded by user
	- resolve - route data retrival before route activiating 

- we can implemenr more than 1 guards as it is array.
