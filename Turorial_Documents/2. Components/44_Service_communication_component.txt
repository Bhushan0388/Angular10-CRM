	- We create a folder
	- use below command
		ng g s <service_name>
	- In app.module.ts we need to import Httpclient module
		import{HttpClientModule} from '@angular/common/http';
	- Also inject it in below imprts
		@NgModule({
  		  imports: [
   			  BrowserModule,
  			  AppRoutingModule,
  			  UsersModule,
 			   HttpClientModule
 		 ],

		import {HttpClient} from  '@angular/common/http';
	- Then inject it in constructor.
		constructor(private httpclinet: HttpClient) { }
	- If we want to consume this service we need to import it in that component
