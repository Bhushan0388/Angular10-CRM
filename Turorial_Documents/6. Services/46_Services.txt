What is dependency injection?
	- Its an appliction design pattern
	- It allows us to ability to add functionality of component at runtime
	
Services
	- It alows us to create reusable common shared functioanlity between various modules and components
	- Servies are singleton
	- Services are injected into application using Dependency injectionn mechanism
	- We need to create and inject service in component where we want to use them
	- Services are commonly used for making HTTP request to our endpoints APIs to request and recieve the response
	- A service can have a value, methods or combination of both.

How to generate Service
	- ng g service <service_name>

Where should we keep it.
	- Create a single folder to place all services

What's inside a service file?
	- @Injectable
		- Dependency Injection Mechanism
	- providerIn
		- Its available wherever we inject it

Where can we inject service?
	- We can inject in any components

DO we need to import it in any of the module file?
	- No
	- We only import it in component.

- Import the service in component
- Create and instance in the constructor
- then call the menthod using instance of the service.
