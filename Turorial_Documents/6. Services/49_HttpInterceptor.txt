		-Authentication Tokens

		- Tokens
	- Interceptsand handles any httprequest and response
	- Most interceptors transform the outgoing request before passing it to the next interceptor in the chain, by calling next.handle(transformedReq)
	- It transform the response event stream as well, by applying additional RxJS operatr on the stream returned by next.handle

How to generate HTTP interceptor
