Resolve GUard
	- Resolve route guard allows us to provide data needed for a route
	- If somedata is Mandatory for a component  try using the logic from ngOnit to resolve
	- Using the activatedRoute.snapshot.data we can access data and process it.


Points to remeber 
- when we run the guard command resolve is not present in the list so we can select any one guard
- later modfiy it wih resolve as below

	  resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot){
  	  return this.userObj;
  	}	

-Then do the changes in route
	    // resolve data is loaded before route is activated
   	 path:'loans',
   	 component:LoansComponent,
  	  resolve:{
    	  data:ResolverGuard
   	 }
 	 },

- Then it above comopnent user below content
	 constructor(private activatedRoute:ActivatedRoute) {
	   }

	  ngOnInit(): void {
	    console.log(this.activatedRoute.snapshot.data);

	  }
