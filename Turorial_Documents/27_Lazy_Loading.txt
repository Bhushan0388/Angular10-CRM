Lazy Loading
	- Angular application made up of multiple Modules
	- ANgular by default will loads all modules at start
	- Loading all module s initially  wheather or not
		- which makes application slow
		- Also its an bad idea to expose the modules which user is not going to use
		- user should not see/use

Lazy Loading here comes into the picture
	- Initially we will load only module which are mandatory
	- Rest we will serve as requested
	- We will route for each module
	- it will help in keeping your builds smaller

From Angular 8, Syntax has changed
	- Please use the dynamice functions

The modules generated using the ANgular CLI for lazy loading
	- there will be no entry in AppModule
	- which means it will not be loaded initially.

Steps
	 ng g module <modulename> --route <moduleroute> --module app.module

	Ex. ng g m payments --route payments --module app.module 

	- above command will generate the following
		- A routing module for the module
		- A module file
		 - Component
			 html, csss,specs, class
		- It will update the app.module

Whenever we hit '/payments'
	- it will load module on demand
	- if you want to multipe components then syntax will be
		/payments/success
